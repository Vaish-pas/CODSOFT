# 🎮 Task 2 – Tic Tac Toe AI (CodSoft AI Internship)

Hello there! 👋  
This is my second task for the **CodSoft Artificial Intelligence Internship (July–August 2025)**. In this project, I built a fully functional **Tic-Tac-Toe game** using Python and GUI (Tkinter), where a human can play against an **AI opponent**.


## 🧠 Project Overview

This is not your regular tic-tac-toe game!  
In this version, you're playing against an AI that uses the **Minimax algorithm**, which means it always plays optimally. If you don't play your best, you lose. If you do — it's a draw at most. 😄

The goal was to apply **game theory**, learn about **decision trees**, and implement an **AI that makes smart decisions** in real-time using recursion and scoring.


## 👩‍💻 Features

- ✅ 3x3 interactive GUI built with **Tkinter**
- 🤖 AI uses **Minimax** to choose the best possible move
- ❌ Human plays as “X”, AI plays as “O”
- 🎯 Automatically checks for winner or draw
- 🪄 Fun, colorful interface with result popups and a clean layout
- ✨ Personalized winner messages (yes, with emojis!)


## 🔧 Tech Used

- Python 3
- Tkinter (built-in for GUI)
- Minimax algorithm (pure Python logic)
- `messagebox` for pop-up results

## 🚀 What I Learned

- How to use **recursion** and **backtracking** with the **Minimax algorithm**
- How AI makes smart decisions in **turn-based games**
- Building a complete GUI layout using **Tkinter**
- Applying theoretical concepts like **game trees** into a real, playable Python game

## 📥 How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed on your system
2. Download the `tictactoe.py` file from this repository
3. Open a terminal or any Python IDE and run the following command:
   python `tictactoe.py`
4. Play the game and try to beat the AI!
