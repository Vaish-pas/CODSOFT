# 🎬 Smarter Recommendation System

This is Task 04 of my **AI Internship at CodSoft**  
🗓️ **Duration:** 20 July – 20 August 2025  
🧠 **Batch:** B41


## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **Bollywood Movie & K-Drama Recommendation System** that gives personalized suggestions based on the last movie or drama you've watched.

It uses:
- **Content-based filtering**
- **TF-IDF vectorization**
- **Cosine similarity**
- And boosts accuracy by giving higher weight to both **genre** and **actors** 🎭


## 🧠 What I Learned

- How recommendation systems work (content-based)
- Using **TF-IDF** to vectorize textual features
- Calculating **cosine similarity** between items
- Combining multiple feature similarities (genre + actors)
- Handling multiple datasets and preprocessing them smartly


## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas 📊
- Scikit-learn 🤖 (TF-IDF + cosine similarity)


## 💡 How It Works

1. Takes **user input** (last watched title)
2. Matches it in a combined dataset of **Bollywood movies** and **Kdramas**
3. Computes similarity using both **Genre** and **Lead Actor**
4. Returns **top 5 smart recommendations** with genres and episodes (if Kdrama)


## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed  
2. Place `kdrama.csv` and `Data for repository.csv` in the same folder  
3. Save the code as `recommendation_system.py` and then run.
